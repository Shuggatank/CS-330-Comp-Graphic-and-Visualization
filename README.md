  ### How do I approach designing software?

   This project has helped my better organize my thoughts and apply those thoughts. I started by analyzing the project requirements to have a high-level overview of what exactly I need to do. Then I break it down into smaller pieces and organize them on importance and function. Once that's done I go ahead and start developing the code. This tactic will help in the future to help manage bigger and more complex projects. 


  ### How do I approach developing programs?
   * What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
   * How did iteration factor into your development?
   * How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?

  ### How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
   * How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
   * How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?
