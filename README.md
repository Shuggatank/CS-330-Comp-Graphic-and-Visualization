  ### How do I approach designing software?

   This project has helped my better organize my thoughts and apply those thoughts. I started by analyzing the project requirements to have a high-level overview of what exactly I need to do. Then I break it down into smaller pieces and organize them on importance and function. Once that's done, I go ahead and start developing the code. This tactic will help in the future to help manage bigger and more complex projects. 


  ### How do I approach developing programs?
  
  When creating the program I first tried to the minimum amount to get it to work so the code wouldn't be so complex right from the start and I could more easily debug any issues. There was a lot of iteration in developing the program. It started from just loading libraries and creating the correct file sturcture. I checked every phase to make sure it was set up correctly. As the project went through the milestones I understood more what was going on with the code and become more efficient with developing the code.
  

  ### How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
  
  Computer science will help me provide for my family and have fun while challenging myself. My other goal is to create and help the overall development community. The knowledge and skill gained from this project will help me in my endeavours in the computer science field.
